# Homeric Papyri

This is a working repository for XML editions of Homeric Papyri. It is part of the ongoing work on the [Homer Multitext](http://homermultitext.org), edited by Casey Dué and Mary Ebbott, a project of the [Center for Hellenic Studies of Harvard University](http://chs.harvard.edu).

The directories indicate editorial status. When texts have completed the process of edtorial review they will be included in a release version of [The Homer Multitext Archive](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive). 

This site includes some stylesheets for quick visualization of the XML files. Only those files in the directory `04-Ready-for-Publication` can be expected to work with those stylesheets. Also included are a few utilities used in our editorial pipeline.

Questions or comments should be directed to Christopher Blackwell (`christopher.blackwell@furman.edu`) or Casey Dué (`casey@mail.chs.harvard.edu`).
